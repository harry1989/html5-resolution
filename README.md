================

This is a repository of applications that I will be building to demonstrate the use of HTML5 APIs. All of the apps are built using express-angular-bootstrap yeomen generator. Each of the demo can be run separately either 
through `grunt server` or disting through `grunt dist` and starting the instance using `forever app.js`
